        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Straight to the Point Archery is a nonprofit archery education center founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen. Our state of the art educational and training facility incorporates detailed technical video analysis combined with generations of archery experience from certified coaches and instructors.</p>
        <p>Straight to the Point Archery is an indoor training facility with twenty-eight shooting rooms (fourteen 10-yard lanes and fourteen 20-yard lanes) and two private coaching rooms. We also have access to twenty-six additional 20-yard lanes and an outdoor shooting field.  We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone from the first-time archer to the professional archer. Once set up with proper fitting equipment, each archer will be given the basic safety instruction to start and will be introduced to various shooting techniques.</p>
